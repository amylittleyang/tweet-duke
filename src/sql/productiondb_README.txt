We used a java program script to generate data for the production dataset. More specifically, we created randomly generated user IDs, names, "things" for each of our categories, and their related tags and comments. We then printed out SQL insert statements for each table by parsing through text files with the generated data, and using a random number generator for IDs and other integers such as ratings and timestamps. Since a thing id (or tid) can be associated with multiple tags, we used a hashmap structure to store data associated with things and their tags.

The key concept was to ensure data was randomized (for example, we used gaussian distribution to generate frequency of tags), and to ensure that all of our references in the schema were captured. We still have room for improvement in generating a more comprehensive set of possible tags/comments, and possibly introducing real data through surveys.
